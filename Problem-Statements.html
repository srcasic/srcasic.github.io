          <br>In our working environments such as home, office, or an industry, we are surrounded by various kinds of electronic equipments which emit various types of radiation. Exposure to these radiations is known to create health problems. There is no policy, protocol or management system available in the country to handle this issue. It will be good to visualize a monitoring system to of measure the level of harmful radiation in any working environment and provide warning and suggestion on safeguard mechanism. A model project in this line will be a good initiative.<br>

          <br>This is an age old problem for the life of people living in and around forest areas. In the last two decades there is an increase in human-wildlife conflicts. This is due to increase in human population, decrease in forest cover and in some cases increase in wild animal population as well. Till date there is no mechanism available to evaluate the human-wildlife conflict issues in the state and national levels. Also to mitigate the issue, no technological solutions are available. Development of sensor based technology to mitigate human-elephant conflict issue could be one of the suggested problems.<br>

          <br>During recent years, due to the technological advancements many sophisticated techniques has been evolved for assuring fast recovery of the patients in hospitals. Need for good patient care in hospitals, assessment and management of fluid and electrolyte is the most fundamental thing required. All most in all hospital, an assist/nurse is responsible for monitoring the electrolytes bottle level. But unfortunately most of the time, the observer may forget to change the bottle at correct time due to their busy schedule. To overcome this critical situation, a IoT based automatic alerting and indicating device is proposed where sensor is used as a level sensor or weight sensor. It is based on the principle that the sensor output changes when fluid level/weight is below certain limit. When Fluid level/weight is low, will alerts the observer through the display or/and mobile phone at the control room indicates the room number of the patient for quick recovery.<br>

          <br>To reduce the Energy losses in Lighting system with effective control.All industries are different, with different operations and needs. There are also different lighting requirements for the various types of industrial activities in the lighting standard, as well as in other applications, and it is difficult to come up with a general recommendation for light control. A well planned lighting design together with a well-executed lighting control solution means optimized lighting for a specific activity is achievable.Whatever the requirements, it is smart to think lighting control at the planning stage, and in industrial and warehouse applications, we believe that a control system is the obvious, and in many cases, the only choice. However, to get maximum benefit of a control system it needs to be project specific. You must know how the industry works and how different areas are used during working hours. For example, it is important to establish if there is natural light? During what times, and for how long are staff present in certain areas? Are there areas of greater occupancy? How much activity is there in, say the aisles of the warehouse? If you do not ask these questions, you will not get the best results from the lighting control system.<br>

          <br>The system should have a smart light dimming module, which will use the following approaches: The first is based on visibility i.e. if the visibility is low, the intensity of light should be maximized. The second approach is to dim the light for the streets automatically when no movement is detected and it will automatically increase the intensity of light. How does it detect movement in the rainy season?<br>

          <br>Recharging ground water level has always been a challenge. Rain water harvesting has a peak during monsoon and most of the time, in most of the areas it’s not so effective. Kitchen waste water has comparatively less impurities and contaminations and if harvested separately, can lead to a more sustainable technique to recharge ground water levels. Societies and big houses can be required to separate kitchen and toilet waste water. With selection of proper bio-reactors, algae, biochemicals, some useful by-products can also be made like some useful gases, fuel etc.<br>
